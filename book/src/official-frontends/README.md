# Official frontends

Intuicio platform provides set of official frontends both as languages dedicated to specific domains and serving as an example of how more complex frontends are being designed:

- **Serde**
    Low level data-based language to supports scripts that can be defined in any format supported by `serde` (for example: json, yaml, toml, lexpr and more). Useful as intermediate stage between editors and scripting.
- **Assembler**
    Low level text-based language that is the closest one to Intuicio script information data format. Useful for in-game operation systems.
- [**Simpleton**](./simpleton/index.html)
- **Vault**
    An attempt to high level text-based strongly typed scripting language with lexpr syntax.
